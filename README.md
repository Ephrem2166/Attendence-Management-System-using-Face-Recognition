# Attendence-Management-System-using-Face-Recognition
Automatic attendance management will replace the manual method, 
Which takes a lot of time consuming and difficult to maintain. 
In this method the camera is fixed in the classroom and it will capture the image, 
The faces are detected and then it is recognized with the database and finally the attendance is marked. 
If the attendance is marked as absent the message about the student's absent is send to their parents.
